==Skewed male, white and Asian at first, the group diversified
over the months==:
On my first night I counted 28 people, of whom six were women and two were black, with a couple of experienced retired
coders present, too. By the time I moved to the bigger San Francisco
group, the Oakland group had grown at least fifty percent and the
proportions of women and people of color had roughly doubled.

==my poet daughter, Lotte==:
For poetry lovers, her work is at [Red
Herring Press][a1].

==Wheeling around Toplap==:
There was a nice symmetry to this new
electronic art form being based in Sheffield, one of the most notable
centers of the UK synth-pop, still taken to define the sonic landscape
of the early 1980s through groups like Cabaret Voltaire, The Human
League and Heaven 17.

==live coding proved to be cultish and yet impressively global==:
On a trip to Mexico City I found a scene there, too, and even
interviewed Malitzin Cortez, who performs under the monicker CNDSD and
is very worth checking out [on YouTube][mali].

==the spooky-sounding theremin==:
whose sound is best known from The Beach Boys' classic "Good Vibrations" or Portishead's "Mysterons."
Film buffs will also know it from the soundtrack of the 1950s sci-fi
classic *The Day the Earth Stood Still*, which made Neil Armstrong's
choice to take a personally-recorded cassette of theremin music by Dr.
Samuel Hoffman to the moon with him in 1969 all the more surprising and
delightful.

==artists like Delia Derbyshire (arranger of the groundbreaking
theme from *Doctor Who*)==:
As per computer programming in general, the high proportion of female computer music pioneers faded as the music
grew commercial, but by the 2020s was in the process of being reclaimed.
A secret history recently excavated in books like David Stubbs'
excellent *Mars by 1980* and on a monthly basis in *Electronic Sound*
magazine.

==the Dutchman Tom Dissevelt==:
Who I first heard about from the English guitarist Jeff Beck, he recalling his friend and then
(Yardbirds) bandmate Jimmy Page, later of Led Zeppelin, rushing a
Dissevelt single to his flat in a lather of excitement in the early
1960s, when the two guitarists were both largely unknown. David Bowie
later cited Dissevelt and Dick Raaijmakers' 1959 LP *The Fascinating
World of Electronic Music* as one of his 25 all-time favorite albums, in
*Vanity Fair*.

###293
==The first widely-used digital synthesizer, the Yamaha DX7,
appeared in 1983==:
The DX7 was based on a patent for *Frequency
Modulation* (or FM) synthesis owned by Stanford University since the
1960s and said to have been among their most lucrative in the years
following the DX7.

###294
==almost everyone used the same sounds and records made in 1984
can be easy for a trained ear to spot==:
An accessible example is the percussive bassline from the Norwegian trio A-ha's huge global hit
single *Take on Me*, which would have been hard to produce by analog
means (as with almost everything on that tune, save the sweet melody
line, which is analog). Initially recorded at the Who guitarist Pete
Townsend's Eel Pie studio in London, this song has a surprisingly
dramatic backstory, flopping several times as a single prior to becoming
the hit it still is. Anyone interested in it can go to See *Sound on
Sound* magazine, March 2011, "[Classic Tracks: A-ha 'Take on Me][a2]."

==it was excessively hard to program with its small digital
display==:
The only person I know of who succeeded in finding a use for
their own programmed DX7 patches is Brian Eno. Like almost everyone in
England at that time I played in a band and owned a DX7 relatively
early, spent weeks working out how to program it, came up with a similar
roster of bubbly, farty, dribbly sounds to the ones Eno found. The
difference is that where I said "Can't see much use for these" and
moved on, he used them to make one of his best-loved albums, *Apollo:
Atmospheres and Soundtracks* as a soundtrack for Al Reinert's stirring
documentary *For All Mankind*. I guess this is what makes Eno *Eno*.

=="you watch the record spin and it's like you're sitting around a campfire—it's hypnotic"==:
Jack White quoted in *Billboard*, March 6, 2015.

==Lanier sees the stripping of nuance we first felt in music as a
feature of most classical computing==:
Some of the people who understand this best are within Silicon Valley. In his 2016 book *The Revenge of
Analog*, author David Sax speaks to an executive at the software giant
Adobe, who introduced a tool called the Adobe Kickbox, a cardboard box
containing coffee, chocolate, pens, pencils and a notebook—an
"intentionally a very hands-on, tactile, nondigital thing." The
Kickbox's purpose is to stop coders being distracted by the peculiar
demands of the machine during the gestation of an idea; to delay their
urge to jump into code and start building, at which point an idea
becomes fixed and they become attached to it, narrowing their purview.

==the limitations and circumscriptions we need to be alert to yet
seldom are==:
In her digitally-themed show at the Guggenheim in the fall
of 2022, the artist Sarah Sze had a river of images flowing up the
spiraling inner walkway toward the top of the building. In the notes she
wrote that after reaching the top, "All of the images in the river crash
and die, becoming a kind of digital dust. I wanted to remind you that
the digital is actually physical. I think the most powerful effect of
the digital is to invoke longing. You always are left with a sense of
wanting more." More on her take [here][a3].

==a new kind of music that is hard to imagine being made any
other way==:
I later learned this was Graham Dunning, incidentally the
only live coder to leave the code screen blank that night.

==his interest arose from exposure to the German *kosmische
musik* fountainheads Tangerine Dream==:
For anyone interested, a good place to start with Tangerine Dream is the compilation album of their
works with Virgin Records from the mid-1970s, *The Virgin Years*, which
exemplifies the distinctive German form of electronic music sometimes
called *kosmische*. That said, minus their founder, Edgar Froese, who
died in 2015, they continue to innovate prodigiously and have written
many film soundtracks, featuring prominently in the hit Netflix series
*Stranger Things*.
