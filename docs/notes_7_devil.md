==an army cryptologist named John Tiltman . . . managed to break
the code==: Information on Tiltman's role derived from Bletchley
literature; Bill Tutte's contribution from Jack Copeland's article
"[The Modern History of Computing][stanford]," in *The Stanford Encyclopedia of
Philosophy*. Copeland also runs the excellent [*alanturing.net*][turing] archive and corrects a lot of
misconception and misinformation around this subject.

==A drawer could not be opened unless it was pushed in and out
seven times==: Dyson, p46, taken from *Johnny*, Klara von Neumann's
unpublished memoir of her husband.

###90
==von Neumann's clarity of thought was orders of magnitude
greater==: In Norman Macrae's book *John von Neumann: The Scientific
Genius Who Pioneered the Modern Computer, Game Theory, Nuclear
Deterrence, and Much More*, von Neumann's colleague and close friend,
the Polish-American mathematician scientist Stanislaw Ulam, is quoted as
suggesting that the von Neumann intelligence might be organized aurally
rather than visually.

###91
==Ada was beguiled by the metaphoric connection she saw between
these machines==: A general note here. I am aware of the diminutive way
in which women are sometimes referred to by their first names, where a
man ("Babbage," for instance) would not be. It has become conventional
to refer to Ada Lovelace as "Ada" instead of Lovelace for good reason,
though. Born Augusta Ada Byron, she later married William King, 8th
Baron King, and became Lady King. A few years later, when her husband
was made an Earl, she became the Countess of Lovelace. Do we call her
"Byron," "King," *and* "Lovelace", depending on the phase of her
life? "Ada" is the most consistent option.

###92
==Max Newman later referred to these as "houses"==: This also
from Copeland, ibid.

###93
==Colossus was neither designed by Alan Turing nor built at
Bletchley Park==: After the war, Flowers was granted £1000 by the British
government, which didn't cover his costs, but he shared a considerable
part of the grant with his staff anyway. For more on this remarkable man
and project, see the excellent, myth-busting works edited and written by the aforementioned
Jack Copeland, Professor of Philosophy and Director of the Turing
Archive for the History of Computing, starting with the books *Colossus:
The Secrets of Bletchley Park's Code-breaking Computers*; *Turing: Pioneer of
the Information Age* and *The Turing Guide*. *Encyclopedia Britannica*
is also very good on Turing, Colossus and Bletchley Park, with the
[online Colossus page][brit] featuring a must-see Open University video about the computer historian Tony Sale's
project to build a working replica of the code breaking machine—the
result of which you can see at the National Museum of Computing, a short
walk from the Bletchley Park site itself. I kick myself for never having
visited Bletchley before I moved to the US: now I try to go whenever I
return to the UK and urge anyone visiting or living there to make the
35-minute pilgrimage from London for themselves. There are few better
ways to spend an afternoon. For further reading on the subject, George
Dyson's *Turing's Cathedral* and Charles Petzold's *Code* are hard to
beat.

==Newman and Turing appear to have steered Flowers toward making
his machine programmable==: According to Bletchley alum I. J. Good,
quoted in George Dyson, *Turing's Cathedral: The Origins of the Digital
Universe* (p. 256).

==Turing . . . appears to have had little direct involvement in
the first computer's development==: Both dates given here are from
Copeland, ibid, chapter on Colossus (p. 40 and 42)

=="I don't think they \[the Bletchley codebreakers\] really
understood what I was saying in detail"==: From Flowers' interview with
Christopher Evans, 1977, quoted in Copeland, ibid

==Newman and Turing appear to have steered Flowers toward making
his machine programmable and animating the circuits with Boolean logic==: From "Advances in I/O, Speedup, and Universality on Colossus, an
Unconventional Computer," by Benjamin Wells, in *Unconventional
Computing* (see bibliography for details)

###95
==John von Neumann went to England in late April, 1943==: Dyson,
ibid.

###96
==There is no explicit record of \[von Neumann\] having visited
Flowers' team or Turing at Bletchley==: von Neumann's mention of having
met Newman revealed in "[An Interview with NICOLAS C. METROPOLIS][newman],"
conducted by William Aspray on 29 May 1987, Los Alamos, NM (Charles
Babbage Institute, The Center for the History of Information Processing,
University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.)

thirty tons==: Dyson, ibid, p72

###97
==Six young women were selected==: See resources at the [Eniac
Programmers Project][eniac]. Having been lost for decades, the ENIAC women's story was resurfaced in a 2014
documentary, *The Computers*. Also worth a visit on this subject is
Walter Isaacson's book, *The Innovators*. When war ended and the men
came home, these were some of the few women spared the fate of Rosie the
Rivetter, as women were forced back into the home. "Rosie the Riveter"
was a fictional character used to front a World War II campaign to bring
American women into industry, to perform work traditionally done by the
men away fighting. The campaign was wildly successful, and women
participating in heavy industrial jobs during the war came to be known
as "Rosies." A superb 1980 documentary (*Rosie the Riveter* by Connie
Field) tells the by-turns delightful and heartrending story of Rosies'
entry into industry and the campaign to push them back out when the men
came home.
    And anyone who feels they haven't experienced enough fury or despair over irrational prejudice in the last few years could do
very much worse than approach the online PDF of Jennifer S. Light's
*When Computers Were Women*. This will make you feel bad, but also good,
because it has so much fascinating detail about these truly remarkable
women.

Goldstine==: From the Society of Women Engineers, "Adele Goldstine, the Woman
Who Wrote the Book—All Together," Seabright McCabe, *Society of Women
Engineers* magazine.

==They worked together, lived together, ate together==: From
oral history archived at the Computer History Museum in 2008

###100
==by war's end, \[the ENIAC women\] understood computing better
than anyone bar Turing==: See Dyson, ibid. Von Neumann thought the future
would be all about baking "rich functionality" into the hardware;
thought programming would be a tedious technical exercise. By contrast,
Turing saw the machine as a relatively trivial vehicle for
software—saw programming as a potentially fascinating pursuit, a view
subsequently proven by the ENIAC women.

==thus was the "while loop" born==: The ENIAC women also
discovered the "infinite loop"—right before the machine's first demo
to an audience of dignitaries. From an interview with Jean Jennings
Bartik, part of the excellent Computer History Museum's oral history
series: "The problem had been a rogue digit, causing a 'do' loop to run
infinitely, ignoring the condition that it should stop at the point of
impact and move on to the rest of the program. The demo went ahead and
was a huge success ("one of the most exciting days of my life," says
Jennings). Mauchly and Eckert had adapted their machine to reveal the
flashing tips of the tubes, with the computer room lit to maximize
dramatic effect. Calculations that took on average twelve hours by hand
were finished in twenty seconds. Snyder Holberton and Jennings handed
out printouts of the output as the program ran. The audience was knocked
off its feet and ENIAC's unveiling made the front of the *New York
Times*, with the story continuing inside." Of course, afterwards the men
all went to a celebratory dinner, while the women were left to walk home
in the freezing cold on their own.

###101
==Grace Hopper and ENIAC alum Betty Snyder . . . would work
together to blaze trails in that field==: Betty Snyder Holberton went to
Remington Rand and worked with Grace Hopper on aspects of COBOL and
Fortran. She had a distinguished if largely unsung career (see W.
Barkley Fritz, "[The Women of ENIAC][annals]," *IEEE Annals of the History of
Computing*, 1996.)

==the program took a month to run==: From Dyson, ibid

==The first serious test problem run on ENIAC==: Dyson, ibid (p. 76)

###102
==writing STOP THE BOMB in dust on the windshield of \[von
Neumann's\] Cadillac==: ENIAC's most historically significant
achievement may be the inspiration it afforded von Neumann, who heard
about the computer while conducting studies into the feasibility of an
American hydrogen bomb. In *Turing's Cathedral*, George Dyson notes the
disapproval of von Neumann's project by fellow scientists at the
IAS—and that, for all the Hungarian-American's genius, he appears to
have favored a pre-emptive strike on the Soviet Union as the Cold War
gathered. It's hard to imagine Turing being so cavalier.

==the first flow-diagram coding==: From Dyson, ibid (p. 209), quoting von
Neumann's IAS friend Francois Ulam. "In that T-division coffee room, I
had watched Johnny, when he was building his Princeton machine, cover a
blackboard with the first stirrings of flow-diagram coding, while
casting unconscious sidelong glances at every feminine pair of legs that
went by."

==We know he didn't intend it for publication at that point,
because he repeatedly refers to sections that were never written==: See
"[Introduction to 'The First Draft Report on the EDVAC' by John von
Neumann][von]" by Michael D. Godfrey, *IEEE Annals of the History of
Computing*, Vol. 15, No. 4

###103
==von Neumann regarded Alan Turing as conceptualizer of this new
field==: From Copeland, ibid, "[The Modern History of Computing][history]." In a 1943
letter, the Los Alamos physicist Stanley Frankel, responsible
with von Neumann and others for mechanizing the large-scale calculations
involved in the design of the atomic bomb, described Von Neumann's view
of the importance of Turing's 1936 paper, saying: "I know that in about
1943 or '44 von Neumann was well aware of the fundamental importance of
Turing's paper of 1936 . . . von Neumann introduced me to that paper
and at his urging I studied it with care. Many people have claimed von
Neumann as 'father of the computer' (in a modern sense of the term) but
I am sure that he would never have made that mistake himself. He might
well be called the midwife, perhaps, but he firmly emphasized to me, and
to others I am sure, that the fundamental conception is owing to Turing,
insofar has not anticipated by Babbage . . . Both Turing and von
Neumann, of course, also made substantial contributions to the
'reduction to practice' of these concepts but I would not regard these
as comparable in importance with the introduction and explication of the
concept of a computer able to store in its memory its program of
activities and of modifying that program in the course of these
activities." This quoted in Randall, "[On Alan Turing and the Origins of
Digital Computers][randall]," 1972, Computing Laboratory, Newcastle upon Tyne.

###110
==almost nothing in a programming language is real in the sense
of having more than a tenuous, figurative relationship to what we call
it==: There is at least one exception. Numbers, strings (e.g. "Smith
despairs of Scrabble") and true/false Booleans are among a very limited
category of objects called *literals*, which carry the same meaning they
would in the outside world.

###112
==This doesn't mean that trailblazers all saw the future of
computing in the same way==: See "The origins and development of the ACE
project" in [*Alan Turing's Automatic Computing Engine: The Master
Codebreaker's Struggle to build the Modern Computer*][master], ed. Jack B.
Copeland. Also "[Turing's Automatic Computing Engine][engine]", in "The Modern History of
Computing", *Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy*, in which the same Jack Copeland fascinatingly elucidates:

>Turing and Newman were thinking along similar lines. In 1945 Turing
joined the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in London, his brief to
design and develop an electronic stored-program digital computer for
scientific work. (Artificial Intelligence was not far from Turing's
thoughts: he described himself as 'building a brain' and remarked in a
letter that he was 'more interested in the possibility of producing
models of the action of the brain than in the practical applications to
computing.') John Womersley, Turing's immediate superior at NPL,
christened Turing's proposed machine the Automatic Computing Engine, or
ACE, in homage to Babbage's Difference Engine and Analytical Engine.

>Turing's 1945 report 'Proposed Electronic Calculator' gave the first
relatively complete specification of an electronic stored-program
general-purpose digital computer.

>The first electronic stored-program digital computer to be proposed in
the U.S. was the EDVAC (see below). The 'First Draft of a Report on the
EDVAC' (May 1945), composed by von Neumann, contained little engineering
detail, in particular concerning electronic hardware (owing to
restrictions in the U.S.). Turing's 'Proposed Electronic Calculator',
on the other hand, supplied detailed circuit designs and specifications
of hardware units, specimen programs in machine code, and even an
estimate of the cost of building the machine (£11,200). ACE and EDVAC
differed fundamentally from one another; for example, ACE employed
distributed processing, while EDVAC had a centralized structure.

>Turing saw that speed and memory were the keys to computing. Turing's
colleague at NPL, Jim Wilkinson, observed that Turing 'was obsessed with
the idea of speed on the machine' \[Copeland 2005, p. 2\]. Turing's
design had much in common with today's RISC architectures and it called
for a high-speed memory of roughly the same capacity as an early
Macintosh computer (enormous by the standards of his day). Had Turing's
ACE been built as planned it would have been in a different league from
the other early computers. However, progress on Turing's Automatic
Computing Engine ran slowly, due to organizational difficulties at NPL,
and in 1948 a 'very fed up' Turing (Robin Gandy's description, in
interview with Copeland, 1995) left NPL for Newman's Computing Machine
Laboratory at Manchester University. It was not until May 1950 that a
small pilot model of the Automatic Computing Engine, built by Wilkinson,
Edward Newman, Mike Woodger, and others, first executed a program. With
an operating speed of 1 MHz, the Pilot Model ACE was for some time the
fastest computer in the world.

>Sales of DEUCE, the production version of the Pilot Model ACE, were
buoyant---confounding the suggestion, made in 1946 by the Director of
the NPL, Sir Charles Darwin, that 'it is very possible that ... one
machine would suffice to solve all the problems that are demanded of it
from the whole country' [Copeland 2005, p. 4]. The fundamentals of
Turing's ACE design were employed by Harry Huskey (at Wayne State
University, Detroit) in the Bendix G15 computer (Huskey in interview
with Copeland, 1998). The G15 was arguably the first personal computer;
over 400 were sold worldwide. DEUCE and the G15 remained in use until
about 1970. Another computer deriving from Turing's ACE design, the
MOSAIC, played a role in Britain's air defences during the Cold War
period; other derivatives include the Packard-Bell PB250 (1961).
