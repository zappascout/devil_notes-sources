==if reality is a giant data-processing mechanism or algorithmic
soup==:

That Keeps Learning, Scientists Say: Basically, we live in one giant
algorithm][uni]," *Popular Mechanics*, April 4, 2021. See also the theory of
quantum holography, as espoused by the late Apollo moonwalker Dr. Edgar
Mitchell: "[Is Our Universe a Hologram? Physicists Debate Famous Idea on

==Among an unusually racially diverse and gender-balanced
international crowd are some colorful individuals==:
With some commensurately surprising skill sets. One participant in our music
session, Zan McQuade, turned out work for O'Reilly Media but to have a
sideline translating Latvian fiction into English, while playing piano
to a high level and being the drummer in an all-woman Todd Rundgren
covers bands. This kind of thing was not unusual at Foo.

==a young CS professor . . . insists on calling our discussion

he tells colleagues "AI" is an acronym for "PR."

###324
==Fake it till you make it, in other words==:
The consolation is that this debate isn't new to the world, or even computing. I've
brought Dijkstra's *Selected Writings* to camp and now find myself
quoting the master—specifically:
>We are in the midst of an exciting process of clarification, of
improvement of our understanding of the true nature of the programming
task and its intrinsic difficulties. A few notes
of warning, however, are not out of place, because, to my great regret,
already now progress is being oversold. Simple souls have been made to
believe that we have a retail shop in Philosopher's Stones that, by
magic, will cure all diseases; in a few years' time it will, of course,
become apparent that there are still a few diseases uncured and then the
same simple souls will denounce us as quacks.  

If I learnt one thing at Foo Camp, it's that—as elsewhere in
life—tech specifics change all the time, while fundamentals remain
pretty constant. Plus ça change, we might say: the more it changes, the
more it stays the same. Reassuring? Let's reconvene on that one in a
decade or so.

==academic institutions whose priorities increasingly reflect the
Google grants underlying them==:
As reported in *Wired*, ibid.. The *FT*
reporter Rana Foroohar, in her book *Don't Be Evil: The Case Against
Big Tech*, notes that Google refers to the process of controlling
research and reporting as "social and intellectual capture". For a
digest of Foroohar's case, see "[Don't Be Evil: The Case Against Big Tech

==software of such luminosity that it puts me in mind of the
Victorian essayist [Walter Pater][pater]'s dictum that "All art constantly
aspires towards the condition of music"==:
I've referenced this condition twice, so it's time to explain. The Victorian literary critic
Walter Pater famously declared that all art aspires to the condition of
music, on the understanding that this aspiration is seldom if ever
realized, so I don't borrow his dictum lightly here.
[pater]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Pater

==the way we compute is changing==:
As George Dyson notes in *Analogia*, early computers adopted rigid programming techniques to
compensate for unreliable analog hardware. But digital hardware is now
reliable to a degree Turing and von Neumann could scarcely have
imagined, able to deliver trillions of CPU cycles without mishap,
opening the door to more flexible, probabilistic approaches to software
as embodied in Machine Learning (where data in effect becomes the code).
Andrej Karpathy, Senior Director of AI at Tesla, has referred to this
new approach to programming as "Software 2.0." Important to remember
is that the underlying substrate remains digital and binary and relies
on abstraction. "Software 2.0" mimics the analog approach of nature
but is not of it.

==awareness that its bottom line intersects others==:
Gebru was not alone within the Google empire. Their London-based DeepMind machin
learning division are known to have insisted their technology should
never be used for military or surveillance purposes upon being bought by
the Silicon Valley giant, even if later attempts for formalize and
expand this agreement appear to have been called off by Google's parent
company Alphabet. Writing in the *Wall Street Journal* on May 21, 2021
("[Google Unit DeepMind Tried—and Failed—to Win AI Autonomy From
Parent][deep]," author Parmy Olsen characterized Alphabet's withdrawal as "the
latest example of how Google and other tech giants are trying to
strengthen their control over the study and advancement of artificial
intelligence."

==Timnit Gebru was an AI ethicist . . . who chose her beat after
early exposure to algorithmic biases==:
Prior to joining and leaving Google, Timnit Gebru was best known for her part in an important 2018
study demonstrating that where facial recognition "AI" worked almost
flawlessly for white men, it misidentified dark-skinned women up to 35%
of the time. See *MIT News*, "[Study finds gender and skin-type bias in
commercial artificial-intelligence systems][geb]," 11 February, 2018. Emails
at the heart of the controversy surrounding Gebru's resignation,
written by her and Google's head of AI, Jeff Dean, may be found at
*Platformer*, "[The withering email that got an ethical AI researcher
fired at Google][email]," 3 December, 2020.

==If Foer is right...then Timnit Gebru was fired because she
threatened Google's hidden core mission==:
A decent early summary of how the large language model works and why it may have rung alarm bells for
Timnit Gebru and others—despite Google's strong commitment to
it—may be found in "[How Large Language Models Will Transform Science,
Society, and AI][llm]," published by Stanford University's HAI institute, 5
February, 2021. The piece, by Alex Tamkin and Deep Ganguli, begins:
>In July 2020, OpenAI unveiled GPT-3, a language model that was easily
the largest known at the time. Put simply, GPT-3 is trained to predict
the next word in a sentence, much like how a text message autocomplete
feature works. However, model developers and early users demonstrated
that it had surprising capabilities, like the ability to write
convincing essays, create charts and websites from text descriptions,
generate computer code, and more — all with limited to no supervision.
The model also has shortcomings. For example, it can generate racist,
sexist, and bigoted text, as well as superficially plausible content
that, upon further inspection, is factually inaccurate, undesirable, or
unpredictable.  

The problem, in other words, is the same as for all
other current "AI": it's not intelligent, it just *simulates*
intelligence. It doesn't take much imagination to see how such an
equation might be—*and is being*—abused.

it. Again, at writing no one knows how.

==biology uses a template system of address, instructing "do
THIS with the next copy of THAT you encounter==:
George Dyson is especially good on this in *Turing's Cathedral* and the more recent
*Analogia: The Emergence of Technology Beyond Human Control*. In the
former, he writes that:
>This ability to take general, organized advantage of local, haphazard processes is the ability that (so far) has
distinguished information processing in living organisms from
information processing by digital computers . . . Our understanding of
life has deepened with our increasing knowledge of the workings of
complex molecular machines, while our understanding of technology is
diminished as machines approach the complexity of living things.

==I visited leaders of a well-funded EU-ccordinated program of research into UC==:

==one researcher showed me how two chemicals, when mixed, formed
themselves into exquisitely beautiful, perfectly distributed patterns==:
This was at the University of the West of England in Bristol. For years
I kept the petri dishes containing these perfectly distributed patterns,
made possible because in nature nothing is waiting for instructions:
every element acts in concert, simultaneously. In essence, computers are
fast but linear, where biology is slow but distributed—which may yet
provide a clue to the future of computing (not least because we have a
vast amount to learn from nature yet). Dyson is especially good on this
distinction, both in *Turing's Cathedral* (try pages 274-6 to start) and
the delightful memoir-cum-philosophical treatise, *Analogia*.

###335
==for this reason Alan Turing's colleague Jack Good preferred to
call analog computing "continuous computing"==:
In Dyson, ibid., "analog computers are stupidly named; they should be named continuous
computers."

==Turing believed that a perfectly predictable and infallible
machine could not be intelligent.==:
Dyson, ibid. "In other words then, if a machine is expected to be infallible, it cannot also be
intelligent."

==The chief driver of intelligence for \[Turing\] was curiosity, so a true AI would need to make mistakes==:
From Dyson again:
>"What we want is a machine that can learn from experience," Turing wrote. "The
possibility of letting the machine alter its own instructions provides
the mechanism for this." Jack Good added that, "The ultra-intelligent
machine . . . is the machine that believes people cannot think."

==chapter one of an unfinished manuscript the great scientist
left behind was entitled "Turing!," while chapter two was "Not
Turing!"==:
In 1948 von Neumann mused that "If the only demerit of the
digital expansion system were its greater logical complexity, nature
would not, for this reason alone, have rejected it." According to
George Dyson in *Turing's Cathedral*, "template-based addressing was a
key element of von Neumann's overall plan." As well it might have
been. In a 2003 talk called "Coding from Scratch," Jaron Lanier lamented
the way hardware was constantly improving while software grew ever more
brittle and hard to manage, until computerists had ceased to imagine it
could be otherwise. "Some things in the foundation of computer science
are fundamentally askew," he said. "If you make a small change to a
program, it can result in an enormous change in what the program does.
If nature worked that way, the universe would crash all the time."
Likewise the brain, which appears to function probabilistically, being
about patterns rather than rules. For this reason natural systems are
"homeostatic," i.e. tending to default to their original state when
attacked or agitated.

Readers may by this stage wonder why Gary Marcus is

he considers that it could be of game-changingly powerful benefit to
humanity in understanding and interpreting biology, especially in
relation to fields like healthcare, eldercare, unravelling the mysteries
of the brain, understanding conditions like Alzheimer's and helping to
meet the challenges of climate change. He wants to see it applied in
these ways, while protecting the human environment from its risks.

==like eugenics, to which \[Libertarianism\] bears more than a passing conceptual resemblance==:
In the sense that both shun the consideration of context. The key tenets of Libertarian thought, as
elucidated in the humorless, teeth-grindingly turgid and literal-minded
parables of the novelist Ayn Rand, are simple: (i) people exist as
individuals and are responsible for their own fates. Accordingly (ii)
they owe nothing to anyone else and are owed nothing in return.
Therefore (iii) governments have no right to interfere in the lives of
citizens beyond the protection of property rights and (iv) only "The
Market" can allocate value to people and things objectively, according
to "merit," without inviting tyranny. Yet the empirical context of
people's access to and relationship with The Market is abstracted away
under the guise of "reason." Two things I had noticed with other Bay
Area Libertarians of my acquaintance were that a) for people who
trumpeted "individual freedom," they tended to have a lot of highly
prescriptive rules about how that "freedom" should be deployed, and
b) in fetishizing "the individual" as a theoretical construct, they wound
up denying individuals their individuality.

==Libertarianism didn't originate in California but found a
fertile breeding ground here==:
The VC and early Facebook investor Roger MacNamee explains the appeal of
Libertarianism to tech people very well in his book *Zucked*.

==the term still being used informally and by organizations like
the Asperger/Autism Network==:
There has also been a re-evaluation of the term "Asperger's" after recent claims that Hans Asperger, the Austrian
doctor who identified and tried to help autistic children between the
world wars, collaborated with the ruling Nazis during World War II. For
the record, the late Steve Silberman, may he rest in peace, told me he was not convinced by the evidence, and it looks a little shaky to me, too.

==Increasingly, "autistic" and other atypical traits—and
almost everyone displays some of these==:
As an aside, extreme care needs to be taken around the presumption of 'autistic traits,' too. Discussing
this with a therapist friend, she points out that behavioral patterns
that look like expressions of autism can often have roots in childhood
experience, parenting etc., expressed through what her profession calls
"attachment styles," and have no connection to autism at all.

==people with isolated autistic traits are far more likely than
average to have fully autistic offspring==:
For a summation of the science here, see Simon Baron-Cohen's book *The Pattern Seekers: How
Autism Drives Human Invention*, specifically the chapter "Sex in the
Valley." Interestingly, Steve Silberman grew interested in autism after
being sent on a cruise for fans of the Perl programming language by
*Wired* magazine. He noticed not only that many attendees displayed
characteristics he associated with autism, but that the language's
founder, Larry Wall, had an autistic child; that many Valley movers and
shakers of his acquaintance also had autistic children. By the time he
wrote *NeuroTribes*, he had come to agree with most experts that any
perceived connection between Silicon Valley and autism was illusory.
Baron-Cohen's *The Pattern Seekers* suggests his original journalistic
instincts were not far off. Like neuroscience in general, this is an especially
fascinating and fast-moving area of study right now.

==identifying autism with what he called "the extreme male
brain"==:
In *The Essential Difference: Men, Women and the Extreme Male
Brain*.

==by his assessment my own brain is highly "female"==:
How do I know this? *The Essential Difference* contains a test. I suspect most
writers, of whatever sex or gender, have what Baron-Cohen would identify as "female brains."

==Whether genderizing autism is helpful or not==:
I confess it seems unhelpful to me on balance, a view the far more qualified (than me) Silberman also shared.

###351
==while the CDC estimates that one in forty-four U.S. children
has autism, it is three to four times more common in boys than girls==:
Four to one according to the CDC and most others; nearer three to one
according to one study, "[What Is the Male-to-Female Ratio in Autism
Spectrum Disorder? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis][321]" in *Journal of
the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry*, April 4, 2017.
[321]:https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28545751/

==these conditions may confer some advantages in coding tasks
like debugging==:
In *The Essential Difference*, Simon Baron-Cohen describes a five-year-old from South London, diagnosed with Asperger's,
whose mother inadvertently discovered her son to have been memorizing
the serial numbers and expiry dates of tax discs on the windscreens of
hundreds of cars on their walk to school—along with which houses they
belonged to. This kind of ability is not uncommon to people with his
form of autism. It's easy to see how such abilities could be helpful to
tasks like debugging code (and to many others besides.) To prove the
point, a supervisor at Microsoft told Steve Silberman that "All of my
top debuggers have Asperger's Syndrome," going on to explain that "They
can hold hundreds of lines of code in their head as a visual image. They
look for the flaws in the pattern, and that's where the bugs are." Shift devils beware.

==He also states flatly that "Autism is an empathy disorder"==:
One needs to be careful with this. One of my very closest friends has an
autistic daughter I've known since she was young and whom I adore.
People are surprised that, because she feels safe with me, I can joke
with and even tease her playfully. I've noticed that, while she might not always understand the
content of the joke I'm making, she can tell and enjoy that it's an
expression of affection. Doesn't this involve a kind of empathy? The only
difference between interacting with her and more neurotypical young
people is that I'll monitor her more closely to make sure she feels safe
with the company and environment we're in. In *The Essential Difference* Baron-Cohen explains that:  

>People with autism are often the most loyal defenders of someone they perceive to be suffering an injustice. In this way, they are not uncaring, or
cold-hearted psychopaths who want to hurt others. On the contrary, when
they discover that they have inadvertently hurt another person, perhaps
by saying something which has caused offense, they are usually shocked
and cannot understand why their actions have had this kind of impact.
They typically find it equally puzzling to know how to repair such a
hurt. Certainly, they do not set out to upset ethers. Broadly they have
difficulty making sense of and predicting another's feelings, thoughts,
and behavior.

==their methodology was different and may have been flawed==:
For science geeks, Anna Ivanova explained the difference to me thus in an email:
>So, what [the German team] filtered out is the process of \*reading the code\*: both their main task, *predict the output*, and
their control task, *find syntactic bugs*, involve reading code. Their key
analyses look at the difference between these two. In contrast, we
specifically focused on code reading in our study, and found that it's
bilateral. Problem-solving (predicting the output of the program once
you understand it) is also left-lateralized in our study. Whether your
bilateral maps in the Siegmund scan are due to proficiency or simply an
individual difference is hard to say :)

==*The Matter With Things* provides a slate of twenty differences
between the two hemispheres==:
A few of these are worth stating. Most particularly, the left hemisphere is:

(i) attuned to the close and familiar, "what is
central and in the foreground;"   
(ii) aims to narrow things down to certainty
and where contradiction or anomaly is introduced will often dismiss or
deny the discordant information rather than seek to form a synthesis,
because its preferred truth is binary and fixed;  
(iii) tends to see the world
as fragmentary and composed of *things*, with the "whole" being a sum of
parts and always reducible back to those parts—a perspective it
applies also to people (which is why prosody, facial expression, body
language have little or no purchase with the left hemisphere).  
(iv) It recognizes and is drawn to
fixity, stasis, the inanimate ("machines and tools are alone coded in
the left hemisphere");  
(v) is most at home with the explicit and therefore
struggles to recognize metaphor, myth, irony, humor or the poetic.  
(vi) If offered a story with episodes jumbled, the left hemisphere will reorder
them according to similarity rather than narrative sense, and;  
(vii) it excels at "fine analytic sequencing" and complex linguistic syntax, with a larger vocabulary than the right hemisphere;  
(viii) is preternaturally confident and optimistic, being disinclined to recognize its own limitations;  
(ix) deals with simple rhythms, but little else of music, although there is evidence that as musicians learn a piece and it becomes grooved and familiar, the left hemisphere takes over.

In contrast (and complement) to the left hemisphere, the right is:

(i) attuned to the global;  
(ii) wants to understand the whole and how to relate
to it;  
(iii) is good at seeing and addressing what is new, unknown or unclear;  
(iv) is attuned to ambiguity and able to accept and hold contradictory
information without rush to judgement;  
(v) is inclined to see itself as connected to or even part of what it observes;  
(vi) sees not discrete objects but complex, irreducible *relationships and processes*; is drawn to the implicit before explicit, the animate more than inanimate;  
(vii) is attracted to and good at processing narrative;  
(viii) better understands the overall import and significance of a proposition or statement than does the more syntactically sophisticated left hemisphere;  
(ix) processes most music;  
(x) is essential to empathy and theory of mind (the ability to see another's
point of view) and is in general terms more open to and expressive of
emotion;  
(xi) is more realistic and open to doubt and therefore tending to
pessimism.

"V.S. Ramachandran calls the right hemisphere the devil's
advocate," McGilchrist writes, "since it acts as an anomaly detector,
on the lookout for what might be erroneously assumed by the left
hemisphere to be familiar. For the left hemisphere aims to narrow things
down to a certainty, where the right hemisphere opens them up into
possibility."

>From a neurobiological perspective, it seems that psychopathy may be
associated with an altered and imbalanced inter-hemispheric dynamic; a
relatively hyperfunctioning LH and/or a hypofunctioning RH. Furthermore,
within the psychopathic population, the RH hypofunctioning is more
characteristic of primary psychopathy with its affective and
interpersonal deficits, while the LH hyperfunctioning is most typical of
the secondary psychopathy which is marked by impulsivity and antisocial
style.

Inextricable Link between Hemispheric Specialization and Environment][two],"

antisocial behaviors including psychopathy/sociopathy and Antisocial
Behavior Disorder, conducted by researchers at Bar Ilan University, the
authors write:
>Generally speaking, reduced RH activity appears to be
associated with impaired socioemotional and behavioral functioning, such
as the inability to withdraw from aversive and dangerous situations,
whereas disinhibition and impaired approach behaviors, such as
impulsivity, stimulation seeking, and aggression, have been linked
studies describing antisocial behavior characterized by affective and
interpersonal deficits, believed to be mediated by an underactive RH,
and antisocial behavior characterized by an impulsive, aggressive, and reward-seeking style, associated with an over-active LH.

==the brain's *plasticity*==:
A striking discovery of the past half century is the degree to which our brains retain "neuroplasticity"
even into old age; an ability to reconfigure in response to fresh input.
In his book *The Brain that Changes Itself*, author Norman Doidge
recounts an experiment in which a blind subject was fitted with a
headpiece incorporating a camera, with a computer re-rendering images as
electrical impulses that were then sent to a patch on the subject's
arm. Over time the brain spontaneously sent this new information to the
visual cortex, allowing the subject to "see" shapes and silhouettes.
Medical science appears to be drawing closer to a generalized view that
the old "nature v nurture" debate was misguided; that we are all born
with genetic (and possibly epigenetic) propensities whose expression is
directed by experience. Only in the binary world of politics does the
old nature-nurture dispute live on unrevised, out of lazy rhetorical
convenience.

==or perhaps a CEO could be found trumpeting an abrasive culture
built on "the obligation to dissent"==:
In their 2014 book *How Google Works,* Schmidt and co-author Jonathan Rosenberg described their idea of
the ideal creative environment. "In our experience, most smart creatives
have strong opinions and are itching to spout off; for them, the
cultural obligation to dissent gives them the freedom to do just that .
. . "
    Even though they might be annoying, he later told *Wired*, "You
need these aberrant geniuses because they're the ones that drive, in
most cases, the product excellence . . . they are better than other
technical people." Franklin Foer, in his book *World Without Mind*, points out that Google did not invent
the idea of an "obligation to dissent," having borrowed it from the
management consulting firm McKinsey, "But it tied them together into a
coherent, aspirational narrative about engineers as free-thinking people
uniquely capable of reconfiguring the world from first principles."

=="If you have something that you don't want anyone to know,

From [*The New York Times* interviewing Jaron Lanier][laniery], November 8, 2017:

with their 'top-down control schemes,' should be called 'Behavior
Modification Empires . . . He says sometimes his peers in the Valley
seem perfectly nice but then they will say something 'I just can't
believe.' He cites Eric Schmidt's comment on privacy on CNBC's 'Inside
the Mind of Google' special in 2009, that 'If you have something that
you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the
first place'
>'Really?' Mr. Lanier asks. 'It does give me this feeling sometimes that
something's going wrong with our culture in Silicon Valley and maybe
it's just that thing of power corrupting and absolute power corrupting
absolutely, just losing perspective.'
For the record, Mark Zuckerberg said similar things, as when he told
Steven Levy, in *Hackers* (p. 475-6), that "I never had this thing where
I wanted to have information that other people didn't." Which was
true—maybe—right up to the point at which it was no longer
convenient to him. He seems pretty keen on that kind of information
these days.

Contrarian: Peter Thiel and Silicon Valley's Pursuit of Power*, by
*Bloomberg* editor and writer Max Chafkin. For a concise sense of who
Thiel is, try Chakfin, "[Peter Thiel's Untold College Stories][col]," *New

==Elon Musk reportedly suspects his ex-PayPal partner Thiel of
being a sociopath (while Thiel considers Musk a fraud and braggart)==:
From Chafkin, *New York* magazine, *ibid*.:
>A person who has talked
to each man about the other put it more succinctly: 'Musk thinks Peter
is a sociopath, and Peter thinks Musk is a fraud and a braggart.' Twenty
years later, Thielism is the dominant ethos in Silicon Valley. That's
partly because Thiel has been effective at seeding the industry with
protégés—none of them more prominent than Mark Zuckerberg.

==When Thiel parrots one of the former British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's most misunderstood claims==:
Thiel quoted in *The
New Yorker*, "No Death, No Taxes: The libertarian futurism of a Silicon
Valley Billionaire," ibid. The second
volume of Thatcher's autobiography, published in 1993, revealed that
the constant and misleading use of her words ("there is no such thing as
society") by right wing conservatives, neoliberals and libertarians
pained her. She wrote:
>They never quoted the rest. I went on to say:
There are individual men and women, and there are families. And no
government can do anything except through people, and people must look
to themselves first. It's our duty to look after ourselves and then to
look after our neighbor. My meaning, clear at the time but subsequently
distorted beyond recognition, was that society was not an abstraction,
separate from the men and women who composed it, but a living structure
of individuals, families, neighbors and voluntary association.
Not the libertarian's meaning at all.

==Thiel has been open about his desire to blow up the very idea
of society, rationalizing his urge to a love of freedom and efficiency==:
*The New Yorker*, ibid. He also sees Asperger's as an advantage in
Silicon Valley: "I think society is both something that's very real
and very powerful, but on the whole quite problematic," Thiel told the
economist Tyler Cowen. "In Silicon Valley, I point out that many of the
more successful entrepreneurs seem to be suffering from a mild form of
Asperger's where it's like you're missing the imitation, socialization
gene," adding that Asperger's "happens to be a plus for innovation
and creating great companies." In his 2014 book *Zero to One* he and
co-author Blake Masters write that, "The hazards of imitative
competition may partially explain why individuals with an
Asperger's-like social ineptitude seem to be at an advantage in Silicon
Valley today. If you're less sensitive to social cues, then you're
less likely to do the same thing as everyone else around you." Roger
MacNamee does not agree, writing in *Zucked* that: "What I did not
grasp was that Zuck's ambition had no limit. I did not appreciate that
his focus on code as the solution to every problem would blind him to
the human cost of Facebook's outsized success. And I never imagined
that Zuck would craft a culture in which criticism and disagreement
apparently had no place."

==history starts to make sense==:
As one Facebook employee told
the *Washington Post* ("[How Mark Zuckerberg broke Meta's workforce][washpo],"
April 30, 2023), "It's like they went from 'move fast and break things'
to 'slow down, break things,' then 'maybe fix it later on a case-by-case
basis.'" Of course they did. There's no compelling reason to think Mark
Zuckerberg can tell the difference between these things.
