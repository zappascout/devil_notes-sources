==a practice called "sealioning"==:
According to Merriam-Webster, *Sealioning* is:
>a harassment tactic by which a participant in a debate
or online discussion pesters the other participant with disingenuous
questions under the guise of sincerity, hoping to erode the patience or
goodwill of the target to the point where they appear unreasonable.
Often, sealioning involves asking for evidence for even basic claims.
The term comes from a web comic depicting a sea lion engaging in such
behavior.
Wikipedia's got you on [this one][seal], too.

==contested adoption of the so-called "Walrus Operator"==:
"Operators" describe or set relationships between two or more objects,
simple examples being the assignment operator " = " (assign *this*
value to *this* variable) and " != " (does not equal or is not the
same as). The Walrus Operator, introduced to Python version 3.8 via PEP
572, is a special kind of operator called an *assignment expression* and
gets its name from its appearance " := " . Reasons for the uncommonly
bitter fight it caused among core developers (and the toll it exacted on
Guido) will be explained in due course.

==it took his daughter to persuade him to seek help==:
Patricia Torvalds is said to have been influential in getting the Code of
Conflict replaced by a more conventional Code of Conduct, and is a
signatory to the [*Post-Meritocracy Manifesto*][meritt]. Bitter [complaints on
Reddit][redditt] about these developments give a flavor of this special strain of
culture war.
    Here's the [Linux Code Of Conduct][lin], as adopted.

==a claimed five million users==:
I heartily recommend Anna Wiener's excellent *New Yorker* piece from 2020, "[The Lonely Work of
Moderating Hacker News][wien]."

==When the *New Yorker* comes calling on HN in 2020==:

==Lisp . . . retains the capacity to make even hardbitten coders
smile==:
We recall Paul Ford's earlier assertion, in his fabulous
*Business Week* essay "What is Code?", that "Back in the
1980s, while the Fortran programmers were off optimizing nuclear weapon
yields, Lisp programmers were trying to get a robot to pick up a teddy
bear or write a sonnet . . . " Well, in case that hasn't persuaded you
to give away all your possessions and become a Lisp monk, Ford adds
that:
>Enjoying Lisp programming is like enjoying prog rock or
expressionist art: if you're into it, you probably love it, and too bad
about the squares who hate parentheses . . . it's as close to Zen as
computing gets. Of all the languages in this essay, Lisp is the one I'd
take to a desert island. It has the most to teach me about the hidden
order of the universe.
    Not a lot of new stuff is coded in Lisp these days, cultish though it remains, but if you google for flight
information, your results will probably be delivered by a system written
in Lisp (and subsequently bought by Google.) The classic Lisp text is
Daniel Friedman's *The Little Schemer*.
    And yet, for all this, I am reliably informed that even Lisp experienced
Hackernews-style behavioral issues back in the day.

==*Hacker News* is ubiquitous and extreme enough to attract
parody from appalled senior coders==:
Nicholas' view is pretty typical. According to him, "I read HN because it is often a source of 'trend'
related news. I also agree with your characterization. It feels like a
bunch of 13-year-olds cos-playing an un-ironic fantasy of Vulcan culture
from the Star Trek universe."

==LamdaMOO was a typical MOO==:
LambdaMOO turns out not to have been the first or even most important MUD. The concept originated in the
unlikely environs of Essex, the southernmost part of East Anglia,
England's east-facing, unglamorous but also magical and intense
equivalent to, say, New Mexico; begetter of founding father Thomas Paine
and Abraham Lincoln's family and many of the original flock of American
pilgrims (Lincoln, Boston and Norfolk are all here); stomping ground of
the Witchfinder General and tribal queen Boudica, whose army of the
Iceny tribe almost chased the Romans out of Britain, not to mention
sundry Viking kings whose burial ships and attendant hoards are still
dug up from time to time. There, in 1978, at the University of Essex,
one of the strikingly modernist, brutalist "plateglass" universities
built in the UK during the 1960s—and soon known for the rebelliousness
of its students—a computer science major named Roy Trubshaw took
inspiration from a series of text-based fantasy games developed at MIT
and the University of Illinois to create the first multi-user platform.
One of Trubshaw's favorites among the single-user games was called
*Zork*, often referred to as "Dungeon"—hence the whimsical-seeming
continued designation of this platform as "Multi-User Dungeon" (MUD),
even though many MUDs have had nothing to do with wizards or sorcery
(and have sometimes been geared to worthy real-world purposes). Meeting
a need, MUD1, as it became known, caught on fast and soon spawned other
MUDs built on the same language and logic, which Nicholas and I would
follow.
    Trubshaw's proto-social network-cum-game initially ran on the
university's own computer system, but soon opened to other institutions
on the UK's JANET academic network (from 2-8am and through weekends,
when serious computing had stopped) prior to becoming the world's first
multi-user computer fantasy game in 1980 when Essex connected to the
ARPANET. Trubshaw and the fellow students who pitched into his effort
wrote in assembly language, before converting to BCPL, a precursor to C.
We, *naturellement*, used Python.

###195
==LambdaMOO is still going==:
There is also an active BayMOO in the San Francisco Bay Area.

==a LamdaMOO Programmer's Manual survives online==:
The LambdaMOO Programmer's Manual was published by the community's founder
Pavel Curtis in 1997 and has constituted the blueprint ever since.

==they are nothing more nor less than primitive social
networks==:
Reams of academic research was conducted into the
functioning of these proto social networks. Sadly, no one outside
academia paid attention. Much of what we needed to know in preparation
for the arrival of Facebook was hiding in plain view.

###196
==obscure late sixties to early seventies English musical
outgrowth called the Canterbury Scene==:
for anyone interested, Canterbury is a sleepy town on the southeast coast of England, close the
nearest point to France, and beginning in the late sixties somehow
produced a stream of extraordinary bands, among them Soft Machine,
Caravan, Gong and Camel—essentially inventing Prog Rock. Good places
to start are with Caravan's timeless *The Land of Grey and Pink*, or in
a more bracing, jazzier mode, *Soft Machine 2* or *3*.

==supporting a local big business tax to deal with the homeless
problem==:
This is of course Mark Benioff. See *The Guardian*,
"[Salesforce CEO: tech billionaires 'hoard their money' and won't help
homeless][beni]." Or for a slightly more jaundiced view of the CEO (or mor nuanced,
depending on how you see these things,) *Wired*, "[The Gospel of Wealth
According to Mark Benioff][beni2]."

=='When Sagar's company decided he should pick up Python . . .
he did it in a week==:
Seeing this, Nicholas notes, "To be fair, that's like asking a cellist to learn to play fretless bass. They're
VERY similar instruments and the cellist already has a bunch of
important musical context and physical skill they can easily transfer to
the bass." I later find this to be true for myself as well (though at a
more modest level, obviously.)

==Say player KingGeorgeV has just entered our Limerick Lounge==:
Anyone who saw *The Crown* will know that King George V did indeed
have a fondness for limericks. Just ask the Old Countess of Bray.

###210
==as Ben Franklin would have agreed==:
In the founding father's words, "Our new Constitution is now established, and has an appearance
that promises permanency; but in this world nothing can be said to be
certain, except death and taxes." Franklin said this in 1789,
suggesting that life has remained at least 2/3 constant for almost 250
years.

###211
==I look up some of Beck's talks and find a charismatic
speaker==:
I especially enjoyed this talk from 2020 on "[Continued Learning: The
Beauty of Maintenance][beauty]". Incidentally, I reached
out to Kent Beck but got no response (which is fine.)

==fired for offering solutions==:
This is Kent Beck's claim in the *Being Human* podcast (#23), entitled "[Leaving Facebook with Kent
Beck][kent]."

==My guess is that the only unusual thing about the subjective
hierarchy Beck describes is that . . . he has been self-aware enough to
observe it==:
Beck ends "My Mission" with some wise and necessary advice, which could apply to almost anything of any substance. He says:
>There are ways my mission began the day I walked out of my first
college CS course grumbling, 'I'm going to change how people do this.'
However, the whole picture only came into focus after decades of
detailed work. That's what I'd recommend to you if you're beginning your
career (you know, the first decade or two.) Instead of coming up with
high-falutin' words, write more programs. Once you have enough puzzle
pieces, then you can arrange and rearrange them and see what picture
pops up.
