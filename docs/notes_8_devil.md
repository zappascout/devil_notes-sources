==saved the first moon landing as a direct result of being forced
to take her daughter to work==:
How so? Hamilton was Director of Apollo Flight Computer Programming at MIT during the lunar years and is often
credited with having coined the term "software engineering" in an
effort to get her profession taken more seriously by NASA managers. At
the end of 1968, with a first landing on the horizon, she was 32 and
often forced to take daughter Lauren to work on evenings and at weekends while
her team toiled all hours on software to control the spaceships. Poor
girl, we might think, before learning that as compensation the waiting
child was allowed to play on the Apollo flight simulator, making her the only human to have learned to land a Lunar Module
before she could drive a car.  
  
Then one day Lauren crashed a simulated landing in mysterious circumstances.
Her alarmed mother traced the problem to a mistakenly activated
pre-launch program called "P01," which sprang to life mid-flight and
gatecrashed the memory, overloading and then paralyzing the computer
through a condition called *executive overflow*. Hamilton raised the
issue with managers, who thought grownup astronauts too well trained to
make the mistake Lauren had—until the crew of Apollo 8, the first
lunar circumnavigatory flight, proved them wrong. Caution validated,
Hamilton was allowed to insert a "BAILOUT" routine designed to warn
astronauts when the Apollo Guidance Computer was at risk of overflow,
restarting essential tasks and scheduling less important ones to run
when memory became free.  
  
The most dramatic moment of the first moon landing duly came when, at 30,000 feet and with the "Eagle" lunar lander
descending rapidly, an alarm sounded in the lander's cabin and Buzz
Aldrin saw the now infamous "1202" code flash onto his computer screen,
which he monitored while Armstrong stood at the flight controls. For
years non-experts assumed this to have been a bug in the software, but
Margaret Hamilton has spent much of her life explaining that it was
intentional—and probably saved the first landing. For chapter and verse here, see my book *Moondust: In
Search of the Men Who Fell to Earth* or Andy Chaikin's superb *A Man on the Moon*. This was no small feat because the
Apollo Guidance Computer had less computing power than a recordable greeting card today (see Ellen Stofan of the National
Air and Space Museum, writing in *Slate*: "[The Apollo Guidance Computer
was a marvel: As Poppy Northcutt, who calculated Apollo's
return-to-Earth trajectories, told me, the AGC had less computing power
than the greeting cards today that record a personal message. Yet it
worked][poppy].") Poppy Northcutt, incidentally, was [the only woman in NASA's flight
control room][only] during the first landing.  
  
As a demonstration of how easy it is to get this stuff wrong, with
sometimes catastrophic consequences, G. J. Meyers' book *Software
Reliability: Principles and Practices* offers the tale of how NASA lost
their first Mariner space probe in 1962 to a comma accidently typed as a
period in the guidance program, turning what should have been a loop
into a variable assignment. By this account (quoted in Ensmenger,
ibid), the FORTRAN statement "DO 3 1 = 1,3" became "DO 3 1 = 1.3".
Hilarity did not ensue. Mariner 2 launched successfully not long after.
[More recent reporting][recent] suggests that the culprit may have been a hyphen,
as reported contemporaneously in the *New York Times*, July 27, 1962,
and quoted in [a 1987 thread on *Risks Digest, Vol. 5, Issue #66*][thread]. Lovers
of detailed computing arcana with love this. The *2001: A Space
Odyssey* author Arthur C. Clarke dubbed this particular shift devil "the
most expensive hyphen in history" (in Arthur C. Clarke, *The Promise of
Space*, 1968.)

==Suddenly programmers became important==:
See Ensmenger, ibid, for more on this.

==paternalistic mandarins chose to classify the work of pioneers
like Alan Turing==:
from Marie Hicks, *Programmed Inequality: How
Britain Discarded Women Technologists and Lost Its Edge in Computing*:
"The British case is different: in Britain, gendered labor change was
part of a topdown government initiative to computerize. Not only women
but also the explicit structural discrimination against them played a
crucial, formative role in the uptake of computers and in the ultimate
failure of the British computing industry."

Ample anecdotal evidence since suggests that

==Richard Brandon characterized the coding breed as "often
egocentric, slightly neurotic" and "excessively independent"==:
See Richard Brandon, "[The Problem in Perspective][prob]," *Proceedings of the
1968 23rd ACM National Conference*. The respected computing industry
analyst elucidates—a little hilariously—that:
>The incidence of beards, sandals, and other symptoms of rugged
individualism or non-conformity are notably greater among this
demographic group. Stories about programmers and their attitudes and
peculiarities are legion, and do not bear repeating here.

And there's more. The author-journalist Stephen Levy offers more
detail in his classic study of code culture, *Hackers*, with special
reference to key members of the now legendary MIT hacker cohort. Most,
he avers, "had locked themselves into what would be called 'bachelor
mode.'"
>It was easy to fall into," he explains. "For one thing, many of the
hackers were loners to begin with, socially uncomfortable. It was the
predictability and controllability of a computer system—as opposed to
the hopelessly random problems in a human relationship—which made
hacking particularly attractive. But an even weightier factor was the
hackers' impression that computing was much more important than getting
involved in a romantic relationship. It was a question of priorities.
Hacking had replaced sex in their lives...﻿You would hack, and you would
live by the Hacker Ethic, and you knew that horribly inefficient and
wasteful things like women burned too many cycles, occupied too much
memory space. 'Women, even today, are considered grossly unpredictable,'
one PDP-6 hacker noted, almost two decades later. 'How can a hacker
tolerate such an imperfect being?'
[prob]:https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800186.810594

==a gender-biased feedback cycle==:
In *The Computer Boys Take
Over* (p. 78-9) Ensmenger makes a convincing case that the
personality quirks of the early coders, who started out working in
Machine Code and Assembly Language, were institutionalized by aptitude
and personality tests that deliberately screened for people like them.
>It is almost certainly the case that these profiles represented, at
best, deeply flawed scientific methodology," the historian notes. "But
they almost equally certainly created a gender-biased feedback cycle
that ultimately selected for programmers with stereotypical masculine
characteristics. The primary selection mechanism used by the industry
selected for antisocial, mathematically inclined males, and therefore
antisocial, mathematically inclined males were overrepresented in the
programmer population; this in turn reinforced the popular perception
that programmers ought to be antisocial and mathematically inclined (and
therefore male), and so on ad infinitum. Combined with the
often-explicit association of programming personnel with beards,
sandals, and scruffiness, it is no wonder that women felt increasingly
excluded from the center of the computing community.

###144
==managerial elegies to the unmanageability of programmers==:
This perception mattered too. While some of the tensions were trivial, others
were not. In the September 1995 issue of *Wired* magazine, Nathan
Myhrvold, a former chief technologist at Microsoft, revealed that, even
in the early nineties, traditional corporate managements could be
clueless about what coding involved.
>There was a hilarious phase during our relationship with IBM," the CTO
chuckled, "when we ran into a lot of difficulty because the key metric
for programmer productivity at IBM was the number of lines of code
produced. Our people would go in and reduce the number of lines of code,
generating negative productivity in IBM's eyes. Bill Gates used to
call this 'The race to build the world's heaviest airplane.'

==from the early eighties to nineties Ada became the new

And is still widely used in defense and safety-critical commercial applications, notably aerospace, where the

==The word "algorithm" didn't appear in *Webster's New World
Dictionary* until 1957==:
Knuth, *The Art of Computer Programming: vol.1,
Fundamental Algorithms*, page 1. The estimable *Merriam-Webster* cites the
first recorded use of the word as occurring in 1699.

==Debate about the real-world utility of *Curriculum '68*==:
From Ensmenger, ibid, p.133: "Not everyone agreed with the theoretical turn
that computer science took in the late 1960s. For many occupational
computer programmers, most of what was happening in theoretical computer
science seemed irrelevant or even counter-productive, a 'sort of
holier-than-thou intellectual sort of enterprise' divorced from
practical concerns of commercial computing."

==Dispute over the proper relationship between programming and
math would never end==:
See Nathan Ensmenger, "The Question of
Professionalism," *EEE Annals of the History of Computing*,
4(23):56-73, 2001
[]:https://homes.sice.indiana.edu/nensmeng/posts/2001/03/21/ensmenger2001/

==claiming a lineage to the Persian mathematician al-Khwarizmi
(Latinized to *Algoritmi*)==:
In his work *A History of Modern
Computing*, the computer historian Paul Ceruzzi notes that "The
objective study of algorithms as the fundamental unit of computing, on a
par with the laws of gravity in physics or elements in chemistry, is a
new idea." I'll be honest here in saying that I adore Donald Knuth. He
is a stylish writer, full of play and humor; of care and empathy for his
reader. Over time I will learn to appreciate his view that coding "can
be an aesthetic experience much like composing poetry." He wrote a
delightful novelette about numbers and a lovely, quirky book about the
relationship between computing and his personal understanding of God
(*Things a Computer Scientist Rarely Talks About*.) So it seems clear to
me that Knuth has the soul of Aretha Franklin.
    However.
    My sense is that *The Art of Computer Programming* is the tech
equivalent of Stephen Hawking's *A Brief History of Time*. I get
pleasure from seeing it on my shelf, from knowing someone wrote it and
that I would be a better person for finishing it, while suspecting that
I won't. The truth is that I had fun with the first two chapters—which
are highly mathematical—before putting it down, unable to see how it
would help me be a better programmer in any direct way. I assumed this
impression would change as my knowledge grew, until I mentioned my
experience to various professionals, including a couple of rarified
system administrators, only to be told they had done the same. This
doesn't invalidate the work or make it uninteresting (the same could be
said of works by James Joyce or David Foster-Wallace), but does make one
wonder whether it ever made sense as a basis for the study of "computer
science."

==the displacement of women programmers in the United States
was an implicit effect of the fight for professional status==:
Ensmenger elaborates that "This bias toward male programmers was not so much
deliberate as it was convenient—a combination of laziness, ambiguity,
and traditional male privilege. The fact that the use of lazy screening
practices inadvertently excluded large numbers of potential female
trainees was simply never considered. But the increasing assumption that
the average programmer was also male did play a key role in the
establishment of a highly masculine programming subculture."

==there was a deliberate expulsion of women from programming
in Britain==:
According to Hicks, this involved the creation of a new
work grade for programmers, to which feminized lower grades were
specifically denied access. She constructs a compelling case that, where
the UK led the world in computing at the end of World War II, the
paternalism of the country's technocratic mandarins had all but killed
the domestic industry by the mid 1970s. In contrast to the American
experience, there are few individual women's names we can point to in
early British computing, because no one was acknowledging or keeping
records of what they did. As the author notes: "Most women in this study did not make major contributions as individuals, but they were important as a class of workers on whose shoulders was laid incredible technological responsibility with little corresponding economic or social status." Hicks also sounds a warning for the US. "The experience of Britain in the 20th century has many similarities to the US context in the 21st century . . . The failure of Britain's thriving midcentury computer industry serves as an unhappy reminder of the ways in which technologies can rarely fix social or economic problems and how they instead often make real the limited and myopic goals of small but powerful segments of society." See Marie Hicks, *Programmed Inequality: How Britain Discarded Women Technologists and Lost Its Edge in Computing*. Also *Gender Codes: Why Women are Leaving Computing*, ed Thomas J. Misa (p. 16)

More specifically, she said "It wasn't just hacking for hacking's sake. There was a real social

###148
==Victorian intellectuals denied women access to university based
on pseudo-medical claims that it would disrupt menstruation==:
As detailed in Francesca Wade's much-admired book *Square Haunting*, on
the lives of five women writers in London's Mecklenburgh Square in
Bloomsbury between the wars. Not only did male intellectuals fear the
demise of menstruation and expansion of licentiousness: spinster
teachers, it seemed, might peddle "oblique and distorted conceptions of
love," with women's widespread employment further presaging "an
apocalyptic war between the sexes, culminating in the ultimate
extinction of the race." About which it would have been hard to complain, on the evidence.

==James Damore . . . claiming women have evolved to be inferior
at tasks like programming==:
For the record, this is demonstrably wrong at a neurologic level. As Professor Gina Rippon of Aston University in
the UK notes, "We have yet to discover any kind of structural difference
which will reliably distinguish the brains of men from the brains of
women." See also "[Brain scientists haven't been able to find major
differences between women's and men's brains, despite over a century of
searching][brain]" by Ari Berkowitz, Presidential Professor of Biology and
Director of the Cellular & Behavioral Neurobiology Graduate Program at

==IBM made a sustained—and successful—effort to bring more
women and minorities into computing==:
McIlwain, *Black Software*, ibid (p. 38).

==an industry in which 7 percent of coders are female and under 3
percent are Black==:
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics [ups these percentages in all cases][stats], but from a tiny and unreliable sample.
There is no way to know the precise composition of the coding population, but nearly all coders use
and are committed to Stack Overflow, so it seems likely to provide as
accurate a snapshot as we can get. Significantly, the SO survey also
tallies with subjective experience and impressions.
[stats]:https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat11.htm

==close to a third have been on the job less than two years (etc)==:
Figures taken from Stack Overflow surveys 2018-21. The most recent
surveys available as I write here suggest a slow broadening on these
fronts. The 2023 survey suggests 75% of pro coders to have fewer than 15
years experience on the job, where 2024 gives the equivalent figure as
71%. In 2024, 60% of professional respondents were under 35 years old.
It looks like people are sticking with the profession and growing into
it more than they did. These more recent surveys dropped most of the
demographic questions, including the one about dependents.

==the relationship between race and technology==:
Just as the monumental documentary *The Summer of Soul* recently—and
joyfully—made clear that while mostly white kids were grooving at
Woodstock in 1969, the predominantly Black residents of Harlem in New
York were doing likewise at the "Black Woodstock", the Harlem Cultural
Festival (and anyone with even a passing interest in music will be glad
to watch this, it's fantastic,) so recent books like Charlton D.
McIlwain's *Black Software: The Internet and Racial Justice, from the
AfroNet to Black Lives Matter* and Ruha Benjamin's *Race After
Technology* have begun to excavate the limited but significant role
Black people were able to claim for themselves in the annals of
computing, while anatomizing the ways people of color were are
consciously or unconsciously disadvantaged by not having a proportionate
seat at the software table in the U.S. It remains the case that the
ratio of Black and Hispanic coders to their proportion of the population
in the U.S., where the greatest volume of software is written, has been
roughly equivalent to women's in recent years (according to Stack
Overflow surveys from 2018 onward.) In 2018, fewer than three percent of
professional coders identified as Black.

###153
==more dogs than people over forty==:
This was the coder and author Ellen Ullman.

=="in 1980 my company had fifty programmers, all in their 20s and

I was interested to see that in a talk at the 2020 Domain-Driven Design Europe Conference, the great Kent Beck
described his early-career nerves upon giving a presentation watched by
"all the heavy hitters of the day." It's hard not to notice that of the
three "heaviest hitters" cited, two were women (Jeanette Wing and Adelle
Goldberg.) For completists, the third was Grady Booch. Nothing about
this seemed unnatural or unusual to Beck at the time.

==only one-fifth of Stanford students come from what
researchers—with no apparent irony—dub the "bottom 60 percent"==:
Neither are the figures quoted unique to America—or code. A few years
ago, there was an outcry in the UK press over figures showing that top
earners at the BBC in a broad range categories included very few were
women and almost no people of color. A reckoning ensued, which most
reasonable people welcomed. Using [available information from public
records][info], however, I found something hidden in the figures that went all
but unremarked: in *every* category, including pop music DJs at BBC
Radio One, there existed a giant bias in favor of the 6% of Britons who
are privately educated. In current affairs, this reached almost 80%,
meaning 80% of top earners were drawn from the 6% of privately educated
people. Among the few women in the top five earner lists, only one went
to a public (state) school, while none of the people of color did. In
other words, if you were Black and/or female and wanted to do well at
the BBC, you better be privately educated. When I saw this, I alerted
some editors I know, including at the BBC and *The Guardian*, but no one
touched it. All, *natch*, had been privately educated. In other words,
it will be perfectly possible for the BBC, or by extension for tech
co's, to appear to fix their obvious race and gender imbalances without
much improving diversity of experience among their staff. Add to this a
34 percent gender pay gap among people with postgraduate degrees by
2024, according to the United States Census Bureau—up from 34 percent
a year earlier.

==William Shockley . . . was a virulently racist and paranoid

In logic there is a category of argument called a *reductio ad
absurdum*, which refers to a proposition that, in being stated, proves
itself false (the classic being "I do not exist.") Shockley may have
