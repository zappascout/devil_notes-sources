onlineâ€”I had to find an old copy for sale.

=="Nature never draws a line without smudging it"==: The fuller
Churchill quote is yet more germane: "The world, nature, human beings,
do not move like machines. The edges are never clear-cut, but always
frayed. Nature never draws a line without smudging it."

==her classic accounting of the trade, *Close to the Machine:
Technophilia and Its Discontents*==: *Close to the Machine* is a terrific
book, by a programmer who began as an English major in the 1970s. First
published in 1997, it was republished in 2012 with an introduction by
Jaron Lanier, to justified acclaim. Unflinching and penetrating, it is
an entertaining and easy read for coder and non-coder alike and comes
highly recommended.

==the signal reaches that neighbor neuron at best 50 percent of
the time==: from "[Stochastic resonance in Hodgkin-Huxley neuron induced
by unreliable synaptic transmission][neuron]", Guo et al, *Journal of Theoretical
Biology*, Volume 308, 7 September 2012: "Several previous experimental
studies have found that the successful rate of a postsynaptic neuron
responding to the presynaptic spike input is typically less than fifty
percent (Allen and Stevens, 1994, Branco and Staras, 2009, Rosenmund et
al., 1993, Stevens and Wang, 1995). Furthermore, through numerical
simulations, some researchers have also proposed that the unreliability
of synaptic transmission might be a part of information processing of
the brain and possibly have functional roles in neural computation. For
instance, it has been found that synapses with suitable unreliability
can improve information transmission efficiency (Goldman, 2004), filter
redundancy neural information (Goldman et al., 2004), enrich dynamical
behaviors of neuronal networks (Friedrich and Kinzel, 2009, Kinzel,
2007), enhance signal propagation capability in feedforward neuronal
networks (Guo and Li, 2011), lead to energy-efficient neural computation
(Levy and Baxter, 2002), as well as improve performance in a sequence
learning model of hippocampal neurons (Sullivan and Levy, 2003)."
