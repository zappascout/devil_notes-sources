==I decided to investigate=:
Then wrote the first UK magazine article on the subject, for the Sunday Times ([He invented
Bitcoin. He's worth $500m. Nobody knows who he is.][satoshi], March 2, 2014.) This
makes interesting reading now considering what we know—and don't
know—a decade later. Sadly the *Sunday Times* has a paywall, but
there's usually a trial deal in operation.

==hashcash . . . would star in Satoshi's dazzling system==:
Originally intended as a tool for defending against so-called
denial-of-service attacks online, its clever "proof of work" concept
would end up in and enable Bitcoin's mining algorithm.

Radio 4 series on Surkov, [The Puppetmaster: The story of the most

==By 2018 and a near perpetual slew of scandals==:
So in 2018, eighteen months after Facebook's starring role in the deracination of
American democracy, its CEO Mark Zuckerberg sets his annual "personal
challenge" for the year not as the usual business-friendly bauble of
self-improvement, but as "fixing Facebook." How does that go? In
February Robert Mueller's investigation into electoral manipulation
indicts twelve Russian state-backed trolls of the so-called Internet
Research Agency, with Facebook and its subsidiary Instagram cited 41
times in 37 pages. In March the Sri Lankan government blames Facebook
and other social media companies for passively exacerbating racial
violence against Muslims in the country, with UN investigators soon
accusing the company of abetting *actual* *genocide* in Myanmar. India
decries a series of lynchings prompted by malicious falsehoods spread
*chez Zuck*. If the tech baron is fixing Facebook, it appears to be in
the sense that Al Pacino's don Michael Corleone fixed his bungling
brother Fredo in *The Godfather Part II*.

Then comes Cambridge Analytica: a small UK-based firm shown by *The
Observer* newspaper to have harvested data from millions of Facebook
profiles without permission and, in the words of the whistleblower
Christopher Wylie, used this data "to exploit what we knew about them
and target their inner demons" with the ludicrous-seeming aim of
electing Donald Trump as US president. As before, Facebook vacillates
between feigned ignorance and dissembling apology. On a shared panel at
the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books, I meet Roger MacNamee, an early
Facebook investor turned critic who confirms that Zuckerberg, his
consiglieri Sheryl Sandberg and other senior management knew what was in
train because he, McNamee, had seen it and told them—repeatedly and
with escalating urgency. McNamee provides chapter and verse on this in
his book *Zucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe*.
