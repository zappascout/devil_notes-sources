In keeping with their parent book, these Notes were a labor of love: I compiled
and built them myself using Material for MKdocs and various other tools. You can
see the code in [my GitHub repo][github]. Providing live links was
painstaking but worth the effort, I hope, because there's a lot in *Devil*
and now anyone who wants to explore a particular topic in more detail can do so
easily. My fondest wish is that this becomes a live resource for readers and
nonreaders alike; a cloud of useful information.

The serious purpose of this page is to set out the rules for accepting sources
as valid. Anything given as a fact and not completely obvious needs to have had
three reputable, reliable, fact-checked sources. To avoid bloat, I
usually provide the one I like best—but do on occasion, where merited,
supply more. In the few cases where I haven't given a source, it's likely to
mean I've checked a subject's Wikipedia page and/or search engine results and found them to be good. These instances are rare.

Apart from being a log of sources, these Notes also include anecdotes, stories,
quotes and thoughts I couldn't include in the main text without disrupting the
flow. You'll find that both (notes and sources) are distributed unevenly, as
required. So where the notes for early chapters may be relatively sparse, those
for deeper ones from 5 onwards can be extensive. I've also included some code
from the book, just because it looks so much better in its natural habitat, in
color, online. I hope to enable the code to be be run, using PyScript, in due
course (watch this space.)

Lastly, while an *enormous* effort has been made to ensure these pages are
accurate and entertaining and that everything works as it should, I know from
experience that the Edit Gremlins are cunning, so glitches can sneak in
despite our best efforts. Readers finding any such quirks (or "quarks" for
anyone who's read chapter 15) can flag them via
**devil-notes@andrewsmithauthor.com**. The Edit Gremlins' close cousins the Time
Snarks dictate that replying directly by email will probably be impossible,
but please know that, whether a suggestion ends up being incorporated or
not, constructive contributions have my sincerest thanks and respect. Mastodon
and X are where these thanks are most likely to be posted. — asx, August 2024
