==I expect to be doing this for the rest of my life==:
If learning
Sonic Pi or Tidal or Foxdot is equivalent to learning guitar, SC is
violin. Lifetimes could be (and *are*) spent exploring it, supported by
a vibrant community including some transcendent coders doubled as
remarkable musicians—and vice versa. Much as I cared for Python and
its community, the longer I spent with SuperCollider the more I felt
like ET in the Spielberg movie, knowing I'd caught a glimpse of home. I
loved that the system's mid-Nineties creator was named McCartney
(*James*); that his interest in making it began with the Moog-based
classical reimaginings of Wendy Carlos' 1968 *Switched on Bach* album
then continued through the seventies work of hairy German "Kosmische"
masters Tangerine Dream—while tapping a computer music lineage
stretching all the way back to Ada Lovelace herself.

==it took seconds to sense the fingerprints of mainstream
Silicon Valley==:
This infiltration doesn't always come from the Valley
itself. Teachers there adopt tech jargon and ideas that will obviously
appeal to parents in the catchment area. For a glimpse of how this
works, try *Education Week*, November 1, 2017, "Schools Take a Page From
Silicon Valley With 'Scrum' Approach," about schools borrowing the
programming idea of Agile project management directly from big business.
I could cite hundreds of similar examples, many in Silicon Valley—but (*increasingly*)
by no means all.

==Calls for kids to be taught programming from as young as three
grow by the year==:
A few years back the distinguished British commercial
software pioneer Dame Stephanie Shirley noted that her first generation
iWatch contained every feature a user could want—save the one
guaranteed to improve the lives of at least half the population by
monitoring a menstrual cycle. Clearly there hadn't been enough women on
the team that developed the device, she said, issuing a now-familiar
call for the coding net to be cast wider. Top of her suggestions for
transforming code culture was to introduce all kids to programming from
the earliest possible age, as young as three—an idea repeated many
times and with escalating urgency since. See "[Dame Stephanie Shirley:
'we were part of a crusade to get women into business][dame],'" *The
Guardian*, 8 March, 2017.

==You are preparing them to write code==:
Having raised two
children, I couldn't agree more with Morgan when he adds:
>But you are
not only teaching them that. You're teaching them the world is full of
interesting things to discover. You're showing them how to be passionate
and look for that ephemeral sense of quality in everything they do. The
best part is that even if they don't become coders—most shouldn't and
won't—the same skills can be used in nearly any career, in every
hobby, in every life. When we force kids to learn syntax, we reinforce
the idea that if something is not a blatantly employable skill, it's not
valuable.

==Right now \[computer science is\] thought of . . . as basically
vocational training with Java==:
When I studied philosophy just before
the digital revolution imposed its hard fork on the world, the first two
semesters contained a mandatory module on Boolean logic. Many of my
classmates thought they'd signed up for a humanities degree and were
outraged to be force-fed algebra: no matter, they had to pass the module
or they couldn't continue with the degree. In this way minds were
sharpened and broadened.
    I have a dream that computer science departments mandate an introductory
module on the novels of Dostoyevsky, with the same conditions attached
as for logic in philosophy. Anyone who (for whatever neurologic reasons)
can't or can't be expected to complete such a course is offered an
alternative and sent on a different programming track (perhaps
specializing in debugging, for instance.) And when this is found to
produce better, more thoughtful and collaborative coders; to halt the
leach of good people from open source, then business schools adopt the
same model, fostering empathy and ethical sense among their students. Some students complain, while others express delight, but
any blowback is recognized as a small price to pay for the survival of
humankind. Would-be open source contributors are given the additional
pleasure of reading *Congratulations, By the Way*, George Saunders'
short commencement speech to students at Syracuse University, which
makes them laugh and helps them be better teammates, while imparting
most of what they need to know to live a fulfilled and connected life.
In the director's cut of this fantasy, literature students are also
introduced to a programming language, but let's not get ahead of
ourselves. Bad poetry never destroyed a life. Bad code can. And does.

==a basic training certificate in collaborative communication==:
The open source community may need to introduce an educational process
or basic certificate of qualification for new participants, setting out
what will be expected and allowing would-be contributors to learn and
demonstrate an ability to communicate constructively. Individuals to
whom this presents a special challenge could be offered extra help or
mentoring. For most of the time I've been writing this book, Nicholas
has been designing a training program modeled on the grade-based system
using classical music teaching. One of the [*CodeGrades*][grade] innovations
closest to his heart is training in productive collaboration with
others.
