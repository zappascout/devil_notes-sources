376==JavaScript creator Brendan Eich==*New York Times*, December

380==Imposter Syndrome is a thing in code. Even top-shelf coders
claim it. Nicholas did once. *Christ*.==This is what Nicholas wrote me
after reading this passage: "still does. ;-). Honestly, 'when they find
out I'm actually an out-of-practice tuba player\...' is always at the
back of my mind. It's not that impostor syndrome ever goes away, but you
get used to it, and develop a broader and deeper perspective because of
it. I wonder if this has anything to do with left/right brain ways to
pay attention to the world..? For example, I know many coders who appear
to lack impostor syndrome, and coincidentally lack empathy, compassion
and social skills."

381==Most coders will tell you GitHub is a little like JavaScript==
or as the Australian developer and JavaScript artist Dmitry Baranovskiy
has it, "JavaScript's global scope is like a public toilet. You can't
avoid going in there but try to limit your contact with surfaces when
you do."

382==decommissioned the venerable Bash command line language in
favor of a newer rival called Zsh==two excellent online guides held my
hand through the process

382==like the blockchain, Git is a supple assemblage of established
cryptographic ideas==

Here, for the first time I am struck by the extent to which our computer
operating systems mimic the form of paper. *Everything* on a hard drive
is contained within metaphoric "files" that might contain reams of
instruction for the machine or a single line of code redirecting to
another file. Which could seem a trivial observation but is not. If
we're having a problem with our software, it likely exists within a file
somewhere.

391==forming and reforming like a murmuration of starlings==
starlings are very broadly distributed around the world and for anyone
who's never experienced the wonder of seeing a murmuration of them, it's
one of the most extraordinary and beautiful sights nature has to offer.
There are lots of videos on YouTube and they're well worth a visit.
Here's one I like. \[LINK
