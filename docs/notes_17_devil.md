==Imposter Syndrome is a thing in code. Even top-shelf coders
claim it. Nicholas did once. *Christ*.==:
This is what Nicholas wrote me
after reading this passage:
>still does. ;-). Honestly, 'when they find
out I'm actually an out-of-practice tuba player...' is always at the
back of my mind. It's not that impostor syndrome ever goes away, but you
get used to it, and develop a broader and deeper perspective because of
it. I wonder if this has anything to do with left/right brain ways to
pay attention to the world...? For example, I know many coders who appear
to lack impostor syndrome, and coincidentally lack empathy, compassion
and social skills.

==Most coders will tell you GitHub is a little like JavaScript==:
Or as the Australian developer and JavaScript artist Dmitry Baranovskiy
has it, "JavaScript's global scope is like a public toilet. You can't
avoid going in there but try to limit your contact with surfaces when
you do."

==I decommissioned the venerable Bash command line language in
favor of a newer rival called Zsh==:
Two excellent online guides held my
hand through the process. These were courtesy of [Carlos Roso][roso] and [Tom Nelson][two]. Thanks, guys: you made my world a better place for a few days. Another I've since found useful is by Remo Hoeppli and can be found [here][hope].

==like the blockchain, Git is a supple assemblage of established
cryptographic ideas==:
Here, for the first time, I am struck by the extent to which our computer
operating systems mimic the form of paper. *Everything* on a hard drive
is contained within metaphoric "files" that might contain reams of
instruction for the machine or a single line of code redirecting to
another file. Which could seem a trivial observation but is not. If
we're having a problem with our software, it likely exists within a file
somewhere. And of course there is nothing even remotely resembling a file inside a computer: this is all part of a grand metaphor aimed at nothing more than giving us a way to think about a machine that would otherwise be completely inscrutable to us.

==forming and reforming like a murmuration of starlings==:
Starlings are very broadly distributed around the world and for anyone
who's never experienced the wonder of seeing a murmuration of them, it's
one of the most extraordinary and beautiful sights nature has to offer.
There are lots of videos on YouTube and they're well worth a look.
[Here are some I like][like].
