#**CHAPTER 5**
##**"The Real Moriarty"**
###p. 52
==Byron's epochal postwar generational lament, *Childe Harold's
Pilgrimage*==: a confusing title, perhaps, until you know that "childe"
in this context was a synonym for "knight."

==Newton, the rockstar rationalist seer of the Industrial Age==:
stories of the sale of supposed Newtonian hair and a tooth told by Brandan Dooley, editor of *The Continued Exercise of Reason: Public
Addresses by George Boole*, in his introduction, p16. Higher prices for
the tooth are given on the net, possibly for later sales: at one point,
I am told, it entered the Guinness Book of Records as the most expensive
tooth in history, although that honor seems to fall to John Lennon as I
write.

###54
==Lord Byron's first speech on ascending to the House of Lords==:
From *Hansard*, [Debate on the 1812 Framework Bill][debate]. And guess what,
through the magic of the internet you can follow this debate.

###55
==Boole . . . saw himself as following in the footsteps of
Aristotle==: and he wasn't the only one. See *The Atlantic*, March 20,
2017, "[How Aristotle Created the Computer][aristotle]."

###59
==a vivid description of her brother's mental state==:
Desmond McHale and Yvonne Cohen, *New Light on George Boole*, p41.

###60
==the *switching circuit theory* of Japanese engineer Akira
Nakashima==:
Radomir S. StankoviÄ‡, Jaakko Astola, "[Reprints from the
Early Days of Information Sciences: TICSP Series on the Contributions of
Akira Nakashima to Switching Theory][switching]," *TICSP Series #40*, Tampere
International Center for Signal Processing, Tampere University of
Technology, 2008.

==After George's death, Mary solicited recollections from his many
friends and colleagues==:
see Desmond McHale and Yvonne Cohen, *New Light
on George Boole*

==a trio of long letters supplied by Boole's mathematician
confidante Joseph Hill==: ibid, p184
