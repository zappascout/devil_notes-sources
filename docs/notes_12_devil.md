==The 10x legend produces strong reactions in my orbit==:
In the back of my mind is Malcolm Gladwell's book *Outliers: The Story of
Success*, which aims to demolish the conventional notion of genius as
numinous gift—"God-given" in the classic formulation—positing it
instead as a secular product of reasonable facility tied to immense
dedication and 10,000 hours' practice. Convincing as Gladwell is, the
romantic notion of genius persists. The peculiar truth is that coding
still seems so bizarre an activity to me that it's not hard to imagine
it being an exception to the Gladwellian norm. Much as my rational self
knows better.

==the UK Government Digital Service, recognized as the best in
the world at public software==:
On which they have effectively [written the Agile manual][agile]. True. Jennifer Pahlka, who founded the USGDS, spent much time in London with "GDS", as it is known within UK
government, and still regards it as the gold standard for developers of
inclusive public software, even tears up a little as she talks about her time there—despite few Brits knowing it exists. In
fact, the reality is worse, because most Brits know only of giant public
sector software debacles like the failed overhaul of NHS software, which
had to be abandoned in 2008 at a reported cost of £700m to taxpayers
(see "[Government loses £700m NHS IT legal battle with Fujitsu][fuji].") What they—and
"they" included *me* until very recently—won't have known is that,
not uncommonly, the NHS job had been handed to the private sector for
doctrinaire reasons. And the private sector bollixed up (as it does no
less often than government, it seems to me). In an interview on
BBC Radio 4, Mike Bracken, founder of UK GDS, ridiculed government
ministers' touting of "blockchain" as a solution to the Northern
Ireland border problem after Brexit, noting that ministers often tout
big tech solutions they don't understand, sold to them by interested
private parties as solutions to social and political problems that
require messy social and political action.
>Like many governments in the world, in the UK we are really good at civic technology, we're good at
developing social technologies. Like many governments, we're also
still trapped in a decades-long era of 'big IT' where we think a big
solution that takes many years to develop will be a panacea for problems
that we have in society.
He pointed out that wildly successful technologies like the NHS *Couch to 5k* app, which has helped millions of people to take up jogging and improve their health without recourse to medicine, were produced by small teams at relatively little expense.

This sort of issue abounded in the early days of Big Open Source. In *Freeing the
Source: The Story of Mozilla*, Jim Hamerly, Tom Paquin and Susan Walton
describe three engineers being given the arduous task of excising all
Java from the Mozilla code base, Java being a rare proprietary language,
owned and licensed by Sun Microsystems.

=="I have no problem with someone wanting to keep politics out
of Python"==:
Easier said than done. Van Rossum's prime responsibility
as BDFL was to be perpetually scanning the language for flashpoints;
dealing with them in advance where possible. Where not possible, core
developers worked to distil debates down to binary yes/no choices and
let the BDFL decide. A sense of how elusive consensus can be in a
community of this size is the fact that even the adoption of
"f-strings," which to me looks like a game-changing no-brainer,
generated significant pushback. In the past, most Pythonistas would be
willing to trust Guido's good faith and judgment. At some point this
began to change, not because Guido did, but because the climate did.
Guido himself didn't seem to be surprised or offended by this, but he
was hurt when people, including core developers, *took to social media*
to criticize him.

==Born within two years of each other, in The Hague (1956) and

As a side note it's extraordinary how many pioneers of the modern computing era were born between these years, from Bill

==I could enumerate reasons for this==:
Well, seeing as you ask . . . In refusing to commit to (even contingent) absolutes or assessments
of value as between things, postmodernism seems to me to be not just
dull, but a charter for sloppy thought, with irony and whimsy its
inevitable chief conveyors. It also seems to me that fans of PM tend to
claim anything they like (the music of Talking Heads and Philip Glass,
novels of Kurt Vonnegut, philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche, buildings of
Frank Gehry) as PM, without providing any clear criteria as to how this
assessment is made. Significantly, generative "AI", in its present form,
is the ultimate postmodern enforcer, in that it is confined to mixing
things that already exist and are familiar, with no concern for the
substance of what's being mixed, or of the end product. The great
[Christopher Hitchens][hitch], in his book, [*Why Orwell
Matters*][orwell], writes, in advocating for simple, clear and direct expression of ideas,
"The Postmodernists' tyranny wears people down by boredom and
semi-literate prose." Shorn of specific context, the Postmodern
architect flatters the viewer by offering something that looks different
but is ultimately comforting and familiar, using allusive ornamentation
not to reveal, but to obscure form and function in the way of a
magician's sleight of hand. To be sure, in shunning the comforts of
familiarity, bad Modernism will always be experienced as worse than bad
Postmodernism. A Cold War Soviet embassy probably looks ugly, for
instance, but that's okay by me because its essence was ugly. Its form
and essence are the same, experienced simultaneously by a viewer. Using
the example of a city I know well, to me the Palace of Westminster
(better known as the Houses of Parliament) is ugly as sin, all surface
decoration and curlicue; looking much older than it is, because it only
dates to the mid-nineteenth century and was designed to awe and cowe the
first non-aristocratic members of parliament after the Great Reform Act
of 1848, which broadened the franchise. By contrast—and immediately
opposite, on the south bank of the Thames—the National Theatre, built
in the early sixties and first directed by Laurence Olivier, is (to me)
stunningly beautiful, especially at night; all speared light and
intriguing angles, borrowing the elements of the universe itself to
invite the viewer in, promising new worlds for the imagination to
explore (and more often than not, delivering on this promise.)

==Swiss Army chainsaw==:
The full quote from Eric Raymond runs, "In early Unix days, a well-known technical paper analogized the lexical
analyzer generator lex(1) to a Swiss-army knife; this was a comment on
the remarkable variety of more general uses discovered for a program
originally designed as a special-purpose code generator for writing
compilers. Two decades later, well-known hacker Henry Spencer described
the Perl scripting language as a "[Swiss-Army chainsaw][swiss]", intending to
convey his evaluation of the language as exceedingly powerful but ugly
and noisy and prone to belch noxious fumes. This had two results: (1)
Perl fans adopted the epithet as a badge of pride, and (2) it entered
more general usage to describe software that is highly versatile but
distressingly inelegant."

==the most popular general-purpose programming language in the
world==:
From 2021, the Stack Overflow Survey has the web-based
languages JavaScript and HTML/CSS, plus the database language SQL above
Python, but none of these can be used to defend a birdfeeder from
squirrels or make a Shakespearean insult generator. Among
general-purpose languages only Java even comes close to Python.

=="*Is it possible to smear paint on the wall without creating
valid Perl?*"==:
[McMillen's paper][mac] is very funny and worth reading on his website. It turns out to have been sparked by a woman who tweeted "I don't want to teach my kid to code. I want him to splash in muddy
puddles and smear paint on the walls and read novels under the covers
way too late at night," to be answered rather brilliantly by a
programmer asking "But is it possible to smear paint on the wall
without creating valid Perl?" I came across this when researching
engineers who left Google over a series of scandals including the firing
of an important AI researcher from the company—to be examined in the
next chapter.

==And Rabble's pitch almost works==:
I got close to diving much deeper into Ruby, in excited hope that I could contribute to
Scuttlebutt. This was when Rabble told me a little sheepishly that he'd
decided to use Google's open sourcer *Go* language for this project
instead!
